	       UX
	Project Purpose

 This Project (The Monkees website) is a build of a frontend-only website using the technologies that I have learned throughout 
 User Centric Frontend  Development. The main goal is have a simple, responsive and attractive website for each visitor.

	User eXperience

Users/visitors of the Monkees website instantly experience a clear, easy and intuitive feel of a catchy website. It's easy to navigate, 
simple and  each section on every page is very explicit and easy to understand.

If the user gets by the end of some page the logo will redirect straight to the top of the page.

 Also, informative buttons with new tab links have been provided at all times to ensure that the visitor still has access to the Monkees' website
even though will get on another website, the user doesn't have to click a back button or to remember anything.


	Design Ideas

Initially, I got inspired by the BSB website. I have tried to use the images, logo, audio and video provided within the GitHub repo. I tried to keep it a 

clean and simple responsive website.

	Fonts

The font 'Aldrich' was chosen as the primary font to create the feel for an original and retro looking style for the band.

	Colors

Colors were kept from the band's logo: Yellow and Blue with some black and white that gives a little simplicity but in the same time showing 
the classic's of Black and White style power. 

	Styling

Styles applied are simple and the function on each element assures the effect expected.
Easy to be seen and to use, all buttons are styled to be accessible when each of them is clicked. 

	Website content

The Monkees website includes 5 pages: Home, Events, Media, History and Contact

In the footer's section there are social media links to their Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube and Spotify pages. 
If the Logo from the footer is clicked the visitor of the page will be directed to the top of the page.
If the logo from the navigation menu is clicked then you'll be redirected to the Home page.

On the Home page there's a slider with 5 photos of the band (3 Black and White, 2 colored), followed by 4 songs in audio format and 
a call to Action Image withe the band's members with a Heading that invites the fans to listen for free these 4 tracks.

On the Events page the Fans can check the upcoming events for the next 3 months plus 3 clickable buttons: More Info, Tickets and VIP only.

On the Media pages there are 3 sections: Audio (with a playlist from Spotify), Video (an embedded video and the video from the daydream Believer song) and 

Gallery with a few images of the band members and album covers.

On the History page there is a short introduction history about the band followed by 3 cards with the options of discovering more 
about the band from 3 other websites, after the visitor chooses and clicks one of the buttons of each section.
Here I have used wikipedia, the Monkees website and another website made by their fans.

The fifth page of r] the website (Contact) is a simple contact form page that after clicking the send button we'll reply a confirmation message.

Other materials used in the website include:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Monkees

logo  and tour dates taken from the original website:

	Technologies Used

This project uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript and various different technologies to work as helpers to the languages.

	Cloud9

Cloud9 is an IDE used to develop the website.

	Bootstrap

    
I have used Bootstrap 4 after using a wireframe designed here: 
https://wireframepro.mockflow.com/view/M163bf022f0f6c816fac7df1bba868ff41553866205430
Bootstrap is used to create easier & cleaner responsiveness in addition with helping maintain padding and margins.
It's also used to include modal features to the website to give it a professional look.

	Google Fonts

Google Fonts has been used to provide clean and eye-catching fonts to the website.

	JQuery

JQuery has been used to simplify DOM manipulation.

	Font Awesome

Font Awesome has been used to add icons to the website.

	Jasmine

    Jasmine is used as a TDD (Test-driven development) tool to automatically test JavaScript and JQuery code.

	Jasmine-JQuery

Jasmine-JQuery is used to ensure JQuery code can be run through Jasmine testing.

	GitHub

Used:

As a remote backup of code used in the project.
As a remote server for another user to see the code used in the project.
For users to view the deployed version of the website. The deployed version can be viewed here!.

	HTML validator

Was used to make sure that the code is clean and with no errors.
	
	Testing

Testing process was made in different browsers such as Mozilla Firefox, Chrome and Safari to check the responsiveness of the website on 
several devices with deifferent display resolution. 
	
	Deployment

The project was built using Cloud9, through a built-in function called 'Git', I could commit the project & push it up to GitHub.

To view the deployed version The Monkees I needed to take the following steps:
        Log in to GitHub.
        Select iiostefanos/the-monkees from the list of repositories.
        Select Settings from the navbar near the top of the page.
        Scroll down to where it says Github Pages, there is a subtitle labelled Source, click that and change the source to be master branch.
        The page is automatically refreshed and ready for deployment, it can take up to 5-10 minutes for it to be viewable.

To add this repository to your local workspace:
        Click on the Simon Game repository on GitHub! link.
        Select the green button on the right-hand side named Clone or download and copy the clone URL.
        Go into your local workspace and open up a new terminal (git bash).
        You will need to be inside of the directory that you want to add the cloning to.
        Type git clone and paste the URL you copied from GitHub and press enter. It should look like this:

git clone https://github.com/*username*/*repository*

The process of cloning will now be completed. For further information on cloning, visit How to clone from GitHub.
